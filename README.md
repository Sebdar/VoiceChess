Our school project : making a voice-controlled chess board / computer

Please keep in mind that we're all french : the comments in the code will most likely be in french too.


Our objective is to build a chess board that's completely voice-controlled : the point is to allow handicaped people to play chess by moving the chess pieces with a electro-magnet located under the board.

The whole software part will run on a Raspberry Pi with a microphone and an I/O board on top of it.
